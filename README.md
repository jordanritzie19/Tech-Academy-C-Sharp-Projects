# C# Projects

These are some small projects I made using C#.

## Projects

- [Car Insurance MVC](/CarInsurance)
- [Blackjack](/Basic_C#_Programs/Blackjack)

### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

### Blackjack
This project is C# console application that allows you to play the popular casino game Blackjack, also known as Twenty One. It allows the user to choose a starting balance, and their bet each round, playing as many rounds as the user chooses, or until the user loses all of their balance. This project was developed using more generic classes that could be used in other games, taking advantage of polymorphism for use in specifically blackjack.
